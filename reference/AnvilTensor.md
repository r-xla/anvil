# AnvilTensor

Virtual base class for tensor objects in anvil. This class is used to
mark objects that can be used as tensors in anvil. Cannot be
instantiated directly - use
[`nv_tensor()`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/reference/nv_tensor.md),
[`nv_scalar()`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/reference/nv_tensor.md),
or [`nv_empty()`](https://r-xla.github.io/anvil/reference/nv_tensor.md)
instead.
