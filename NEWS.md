# anvil (development version)

## Breaking Changes

* `AnvilTensor`/`nv_tensor` were renamed to `AnvilArray` and `nv_array` to be
  more in line with R's `array()`.
  Also, `nv_aten()` was renamed to `nv_aval()`.
* Subsetting with `list()` (e.g. `x[list(1, 3)]`) is no longer supported.
  Use `array()` to wrap the indices instead, e.g. `x[array(c(1L, 3L))]`.
  This mirrors the input convention used everywhere else in the package.
* Removed *debug mode*.
* Remove NSE support for `nvl_if`. It now requires passing 0-argument
  closures as `true` and `false` arguments.

## New Features

* Better composability:
  `jit()`ted functions can now be used in other `jit()`-calls.
  This is the mechanism underlying the new *eager mode*.
* *Eager mode* was added:
  This means, you can now do `nv_add(1, nv_array(1:2))` and it will
  actually perform the computation and not only do type inference.
* An experimental [{quickr}](https://github.com/t-kalinowski/quickr) backend was added
  It only runs on CPU for now and supports a subset of available operations.
  You can enable it globally via the `backend` argument in `jit()` and
  `nv_array()` or via the `anvil.default_backend` option.
* New primitives:
  * `nvl_cholesky()` to compute the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix.
  * `nvl_triangular_solve()` to solve a system of linear equations with a triangular matrix.
* New API functions:
  * `nv_diag()` to create a diagonal matrix from a 1-D tensor.
  * `nv_eye()` to create an identity matrix.
  * `nv_solve()` to solve a system of linear equations.
  * `nv_cholesky()` to compute the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix.
  * `nv_device()` constructs a backend-specific device object (e.g. `nv_device("cpu")`)
    that can be passed as `device` to array constructors like `nv_fill()` or `nv_iota()`.
* New S3 methods `dim()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, and `length()` for anvil arrays.
* Printing tensors via `nv_print()` now also works on GPUs.
* R vectors of length 1 and arrays are now auto-converted when being passed
  to `jit`ted functions.

## Performance

* Many operations are now done asynchronously, which improves performance,
  especially on GPUs.

## Bug Fixes

* +-Inf/NaN are correctly created for `f64` when inlined into the XLA exectuable (#182).
  This caused wrong results with e.g. `nv_reduce_max()` when working with `f64`.
* Corrected argument checks in `nv_iota()`.
* Fix check that `wrt` arguments in `gradient()` must be floats.

## Documentation

* New vignette on implementing Gaussian Processes.
* New vignette on implementing Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
* An installation guide was added.

## Miscellaneous

* Linux on ARM is now supported (CPU only).
* To use the CUDA backend, it is now possible to install the `cuda12.8`
  package (see installation guide), which only requires a compatible CUDA
  driver.
