# anvil (development version)

## New Features

* New primitives:
  * `nvl_cholesky()` to compute the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix.
  * `nvl_triangular_solve()` to solve a system of linear equations with a triangular matrix.
* New API functions:
  * `nv_diag()` to create a diagonal matrix from a 1-D tensor.
  * `nv_eye()` to create an identity matrix.
  * `nv_solve()` to solve a system of linear equations.
  * `nv_cholesky()` to compute the Cholesky decomposition of a matrix.


## Bug Fixes

* +-Inf/NaN are correctly created for `f64` when inlined into the XLA exectuable (#182).
  This caused wrong results with e.g. `nv_reduce_max()` when working with `f64`.
* Corrected argument checks in `nv_iota()`.

## Documentation

* New vignette on implementing Gaussian Processes.
* New vignette on implementing Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
