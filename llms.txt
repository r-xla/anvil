# anvil

Composable code transformation framework for R, allowing you to run
numerical programs at the speed of light. It currently implements JIT
compilation for very fast execution and backward-mode automatic
differentiation. Programs can run on various hardware backends,
including CPU and GPU.

## Installation

In order to install from source, you need a C++20 compiler, as well as
`libprotobuf` and the `protobuf-compiler`.

``` r
pak::pak("r-xla/anvil")
```

You can also install from
[r-universe](https://r-xla.r-universe.dev/builds), by adding the code
below to your `.Rprofile`.

``` r
options(repos = c(
  rxla = "https://r-xla.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"
))
```

## Quick Start

Below, we create a standard R function. We cannot directly call this
function, but first need to wrap it in a [`jit()`](reference/jit.md)
call. If the resulting function is then called on `AnvilTensor`s – the
primary data type in {anvil} – it will be JIT compiled and subsequently
executed.

``` r
library(anvil)
f <- function(a, b, x) {
  a * x + b
}
f_jit <- jit(f)

a <- nv_scalar(1.0)
b <- nv_scalar(-2.0)
x <- nv_scalar(3.0)

f_jit(a, b, x)
#> AnvilTensor 
#>  1.0000
#> [ CPUf32{} ]
```

Through automatic differentiation, we can also obtain the gradient of
the above function.

``` r
g_jit <- jit(gradient(f, wrt = c("a", "b")))
g_jit(a, b, x)
#> $a
#> AnvilTensor 
#>  3.0000
#> [ CPUf32{} ] 
#> 
#> $b
#> AnvilTensor 
#>  1.0000
#> [ CPUf32{} ]
```

## Main Features

- Automatic Differentiation:
  - Gradients for functions with scalar outputs are supported.
- Fast:
  - Code is JIT compiled into a single kernel.
  - Runs on different hardware backends, including CPU and GPU.
- Easy to extend and contribute:
  - The package is written almost entirely in R.
  - It is easy to add new primitives.
  - It (will be) possible to add new transformations, a.k.a.
    interpretation rules.

## When to use this package?

While {anvil} allows to run certain types of programs extremely fast, it
only applies to a certain category of problems. Specifically, it is
suitable for numerical algorithms, such as optimizing bayesian models,
training neural networks or more generally numerical optimization.
Another restriction is that {anvil} needs to re-compile the code for
each new unique input shape. This has the advantage, that the compiler
can make memory optimizations, but the compilation overhead might be a
problem for fast running programs.
