\title{Primitive Dynamic Slice}
\usage{
nvl_dynamic_slice(operand, ..., slice_sizes)
}
\arguments{
\item{operand}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Operand.}

\item{...}{Scalar tensor start indices (1-based), one per dimension.}

\item{slice_sizes}{(\code{integer()})\cr
Size of the slice in each dimension.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{tensorish}}
}
\description{
Extracts a dynamically positioned slice from a tensor.
The start position is specified at runtime via tensor indices.
}
\section{Out Of Bounds Behavior}{

If the slice would extend beyond the bounds of the operand tensor,
the start indices are clamped so that the slice fits within the tensor.
This means that out-of-bounds indices will not cause an error, but
the effective start position may differ from the requested one.

For example, slicing a tensor of shape \code{c(10)} with \code{start_indices = 8}
and \code{slice_sizes = 5} will effectively use \code{start_indices = 6} to keep
the slice within bounds.
