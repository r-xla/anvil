\title{Compute All Combinations of Start Indices}
\usage{
nv_meshgrid_start_indices(start_indices_per_dim)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_indices_per_dim}{A list where each element is a 1-D tensor
containing the start indices for that dimension.}
}
\value{
A 2-D tensor of shape \verb{(n_combinations, n_dims)} where each row
is one combination of start indices.
}
\description{
Given a list of start indices per dimension, computes all combinations
(cartesian product) of these indices. This is used for scatter/gather
operations where multiple dimensions have scattered indices.
}
\details{
For example, if \code{start_indices_per_dim = list(tensor(c(1, 3)), tensor(c(2, 4)), tensor(7), tensor(2))}:
\itemize{
\item Dimension 1 has indices: 1, 3 (2 values)
\item Dimension 2 has indices: 2, 4 (2 values)
\item Dimension 3 has index: 7 (1 value)
\item Dimension 4 has index: 2 (1 value)
}

The result is a tensor with shape (4, 4):

}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
