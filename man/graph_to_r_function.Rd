\title{Convert a Graph to an R function}
\usage{
graph_to_r_function(graph, include_declare = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{(\code{\link{Graph}})\cr
Graph to convert.}

\item{include_declare}{(\code{logical(1)})\cr
Whether to include a \code{declare(type(...))} call at the top of the function
body (useful for {quickr}). In plain R it is treated as a no-op. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
(\code{function})
}
\description{
Converts (a supported subset of) \code{anvil::Graph} objects into a plain R
function that evaluates the same computation using base R operators.
}
\details{
This is intended as a bridge to tools like {quickr}, which can consume R
functions.
