\section{Broadcasting Rules}{

We follow the standard NumPy broadcasting rules:
\enumerate{
\item If the tensors have different numbers of dimensions, prepend 1s to the shape of the smaller tensor.
\item For each dimension, if:
\itemize{
\item the sizes are the same, do nothing.
\item one of the tensors has size 1, expand it to the corresponding size of the other tensor.
\item the sizes are different and neither is 1, raise an error.
}
}
}
