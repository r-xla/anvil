\title{Primitive Broadcast}
\usage{
nvl_broadcast_in_dim(operand, shape, broadcast_dimensions)
}
\arguments{
\item{operand}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Tensorish value of any data type.}

\item{shape}{(\code{integer()})\cr
Target shape. Each mapped dimension must either match the corresponding
operand dimension or the operand dimension must be 1.}

\item{broadcast_dimensions}{(\code{integer()})\cr
Maps each dimension of \code{operand} to a dimension of the output.
Must have length equal to the number of dimensions of \code{operand}.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{tensorish}}\cr
Has the same data type as the input and the given \code{shape}.
It is ambiguous if the input is ambiguous.
}
\description{
Broadcasts a tensor to a new shape by replicating the data along new or size-1 dimensions.
