\usage{
nvl_dynamic_update_slice(operand, update, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{operand}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Operand.}

\item{update}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Update tensor with the new values.}

\item{...}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Start indices as scalar tensors (1-based).}

\value{
\code{\link{tensorish}}
}
\description{
Updates a dynamically positioned slice in a tensor.

\details{
\subsection{Out-of-Bounds Behavior}{

If \code{start_indices} would cause the update to extend beyond the operand's bounds,
the indices are automatically adjusted (clamped) to keep the update within bounds.
The adjustment formula is:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{adjusted_start_indices = clamp(1, start_indices, shape(operand) - shape(update) + 1)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This means:
\itemize{
\item Negative or zero indices are clamped to 1 (the minimum valid 1-based index).
\item Indices that would cause the update to go beyond the operand are clamped to
ensure the update fits within the operand's bounds.
\item Only the portion of \code{update} that overlaps with the clamped region is written
to \code{operand}.
}
}
}
