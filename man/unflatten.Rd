\usage{
unflatten(node, x)
}
\arguments{
\item{node}{(\code{Node})\cr
Tree describing the target structure, as returned by \code{\link[=build_tree]{build_tree()}}.}

\item{x}{(list)\cr
Flat list of leaf values, typically produced by \code{\link[=flatten]{flatten()}}.}
}
\value{
The reconstructed nested structure (list or single value).
}
\description{
Reconstructs a nested structure from a flat list by using a tree previously
created with \code{\link[=build_tree]{build_tree()}}. Each \code{LeafNode} in the tree selects the
corresponding element from \code{x} by index, and \code{ListNode}s restore the
original nesting and names.
}
\examples{
x <- list(a = 1, b = list(c = 2, d = 3))
tree <- build_tree(x)
flat <- flatten(x)

unflatten(tree, flat)

unflatten(tree, list(10, 20, 30))
