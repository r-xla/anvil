\usage{
nv_dynamic_slice(operand, ..., slice_sizes)
}
\arguments{
\item{operand}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Operand.}

\item{...}{(\code{\link{tensorish}})\cr
Start indices as scalar tensors (1-based).}

\item{slice_sizes}{(\code{integer()})\cr
Size of the slice in each dimension.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{tensorish}}
}
\description{
Extracts a dynamically positioned slice from a tensor.
}
\details{
\subsection{Out-of-Bounds Behavior}{

If \code{start_indices} would cause the slice to extend beyond the operand's bounds,
the indices are automatically adjusted (clamped) to keep the slice within bounds.
The adjustment formula is:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{adjusted_start_indices = clamp(1, start_indices, shape(operand) - slice_sizes + 1)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

This means:
\itemize{
\item Negative or zero indices are clamped to 1 (the minimum valid 1-based index).
\item Indices that would cause the slice to go beyond the operand are clamped to
ensure the slice fits within the operand's bounds.
}
}
